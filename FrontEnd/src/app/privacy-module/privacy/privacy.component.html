                      <p>
                        Application may obtain the following types of information from or concerning you or your mobile phone device, which may include information that can be used to identify you as specified below ("Personally Identifying Information"):
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        User Provided Information: You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your mobile phone number and mobile device information to application when choosing to participate in various uses of the Service, such as registering as a user. In order to provide the service, Application will periodically access your address book or contact list on your mobile phone to locate the mobile phone numbers of other users ("in-network" numbers) of application, or otherwise categorize other mobile phone numbers as "out-network" numbers, which are stored as one-way irreversibly hashed values.
                      </p>
                      <h6>The Information Application Does Not Collect</h6>
                      <p>
                        Application does not collect names, emails, addresses or other contact information from its users' mobile address book or contact lists other than mobile phone numbers-the application will associate whatever name the Application user has assigned to the mobile telephone number in his/her mobile address book or contact list - and this occurs dynamically on the mobile device itself and not on servers and is not transmitted to Application. This means that if you have your friend's mobile phone number associated with the name "Shakespeare" in your mobile address book, that's the name that will appear for that mobile phone number in your application contact list.

Any billing information that may be collected from you will be deleted thirty (30) days after the termination of your account. Any Personally Identifiable Information or status content that you voluntarily disclose on the application becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by other users of the application (unless such user is blocked by you). Your name (as it is saved in other user's mobile phone address book or contact list) may be displayed to other users when you update your status messages through the application and other users may contact you through the Service. We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your mobile phone number (or email address, if provided) without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Company Site or service changes or for customer service purposes). Hopefully we improve the Company Site and Service and don't make it suck worse.
